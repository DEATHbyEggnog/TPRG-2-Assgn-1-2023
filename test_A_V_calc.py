This file is to be the test_A_V_calc.py file to be used with your A_V_calc.py and pytest.
This must test each of your Area/Volume functions, with a least 3 examples for each of the
5 functions your chose to use.
A/V calculator Menu
(Level 0)
Enter Q/q to quit â€“ select either will gracefully close the 
application and cancel the calculated view option, if set.
Enter V/v to change the calculated view or D/d for default 
view.
(Level 1)
1. First Area/Volume* calulation
2. Second Area/Volume* calculation
3. Third Area/Volume* calculation
4. Fourth Area/Volume* calculation
5. Fifth Area/Volume* calculation

As this stands it will NOT work with your A_V_calc.py file.
